{"name":"C-LIME","tagline":"C-LIME File Format library","body":"LIME (which can stand for Lattice QCD Interchange Message Encapsulation or more generally, Large Internet Message Encapsulation) is a simple packaging scheme for combining records containing ASCII and/or binary data. Its ancestors are the Unix cpio and tar formats and the Microsoft Corporation DIME (Direct Internet Message Encapsulation) format. It is simpler and allows record sizes up to $2^{63}$ bytes, making chunking unnecessary for the foreseeable future. Unlike tar and cpio, the records are not associated with Unix files. They are identified only by a record-type (LIME type) character string, analogous to the familiar MIME application type. The LIME software package consists of a C-language API for creating, reading, writing, and manipulating LIME files and a small set of utilities for examining, packing and unpacking LIME files.\r\n\r\n### Code releases:\r\n\r\nThe current version of c-lime is lime-1.3.2. It can be downloaded as [lime-1.3.2.tar.gz](http://usqcd-software.github.io/downloads/c-lime/lime-1.3.2.tar.gz).\r\n\r\nChanges since version 1.3.1 are (1) Adding an error message when a premature EOF is reached.\r\nThe most recent version of the manual is [lime_1p2.pdf](./lime_1p2.pdf).\r\n\r\nCurrent and past releases can be found [here](http://usqcd-software.github.io/downloads/c-lime/).\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this development comes from the U.S. Dept. of Energy SciDAC program. See the [USQCD](http://www.usqcd.org) home pages for more details.\r\n\r\nSource code:\r\n\r\nThe latest releases of C-LIME and SciDAC software can be found on the the [USQCD Software page](http://usqcd-software.github.io).
